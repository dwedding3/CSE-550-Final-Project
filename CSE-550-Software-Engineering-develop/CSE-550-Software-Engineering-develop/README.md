Repo for UofL Software Engineering Class Project 'Butler Bot'

### Getting Started 

In order to run the bot, you will need to get the token from the discord developer account https://discord.com/developers/applications.
You will need to use the following login:

`username: discordbotcse@gmail.com`

`password: discordbot123`

In the `Source` directory, rename `token_example.json` to `token.json` and paste the token into the file. 

Bot can be started by running `python main.py` from the Source directory.
